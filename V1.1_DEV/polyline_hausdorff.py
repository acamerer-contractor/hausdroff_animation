********************************************************************

CONVENTIONS:
    The two polylines are referred to as A and B.

    Lowercase a or b indicates the index of either a vertex or segment on 
    A or B.

    For a polyline with n vertices, vertices are indexed 0 to n-1 and segments 
    are indexed 0 to n-2

DEFINITIONS:
    k-value:        float
        The "relative location" along a segment of polyline A.
        - At the start of the segment, k=0
        - At the end of the segment, k=1
    q-value:        float
        The "relative distance" to a segment of polyline A, i.e. the 
        perpendicular distance to the segment divided by the length of the 
        segment.
    component:      (bool, int)
        A tuple of two values identifying a component of polyline B, consisting of:
            bool:   If True the component is a segment, if False it is a vertex
            int:      The index of the vertex or segment on polyline B
    distance representation:      (bool, float, float)
        A tuple of three values containing information needed to compute the 
        distance from any point on a segment "a" of A to component b of B:
            bool:   If True b is a segment, if False it is a vertex
            float:  The k-value of the projection of vertex b onto segment a, or
                    The k-value of the point of intersection of segment b with segment a, or
                    None if b is a segment parallel to a
            float:  The sin of the angle between a & b (if b is a non-parallel segment)
                    The q-distance from b to a (if b is a vertex or segment parallel to a)

        If 0, the source location is on polyline A.

    srccomp : (bool,int)
        The index of the component (vertex or segment) of the source polyline

    trgcomps : [(bool, int)]
        List of components of the target polyline that is equally close to

        polyline.
